    Current car goal is to buy a supra. Theres just something about the car that gets my attention. I started getting into cars through a friends
    and at first I really didnt know anything. I kinda got into the car scene and learned that people will go crazy for an old supra.
    They are hard to get though and cost a lot if you find one so I figure since they make them again my chance to get one would be a new one.
    They brought it back after years and recently with a manual transmission.
