  <h2>PC origin story</h2>
  <p class="body">I built it in 2021 during covid. The inspiration came from my friends as they all somehow seemed to have built PC's. 
    I went to the Micro Center in Irvine and bought everything the only thing that was hard to get was the graphics card because 
    people were buying them to mine bitcoin.

  <h2>PC capability </h2>
  <p class="body">Have the power to run any game with high on all the settings turned on such as ARK for example. 
    It works great for multitasking as I can open tabs and have apps running in the back easy with no slowing down. I used to have
    a really old computer that would take a minute or two to boot up and now its up and seconds I love it.
