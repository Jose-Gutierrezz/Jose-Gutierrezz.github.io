    <h3> Travels</h3>
    <!-- Requirement-1.G-->
    <p class="body"> Travelling has become something you can say I'm addicted to now. It started with small trips
        to different parts of Mexico as my family is from there. I have been to Spain and Japan I would say those are
        my most noteworthy trips. Inside the US I've traveled to New York, San Francisco, and Oregon. I hope to expand my travels very soon as it is fun seeing new places and indulging in
        new activities. One place that I would love to vist next would be South Korea.

    <h3> Activities</h3>
    <!--Requirement-1.J-->
    <p class="body"> When I have free time I find myself at the gym or playing video games on my <a href="mypc.html">computer</a>. I try to workout 4
         times a week for about an hour and 20 minutes. My goal is just to be as strong as I can. When I game I play league of legends
       mostly because I think of it as chess. The goal is to outplay the enemy team but I do find it sucks when you lose because the games
      take roughly 30 minutes. They have a game mode called rank where you gain LP points and move up in ranks.
